what we're going to do here is to build a model in order to predict the religion of a given country.

As they are more than two countries, we're going to make a multilabel classification.

the first step, I think, is to binarise datas. but I'll check in the internet before going on.
I also think it's better to begin with a simple data set such as iris, because i've never been doing multilabel classification.
